# This is an example user-seed.conf.  Use this file to create an initial login.
#
# NOTE: When starting Splunk for first time, hash of password is stored in
# $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/user-seed.conf and password file is seeded
# with this hash. This file can also be used to set default username and
# password, if $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/passwd is not present. If the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/passwd
# file is present, the settings in this file (user-seed.conf) 
# are not used.
#
# To use this configuration, copy the configuration block into user-seed.conf 
# in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/. You must restart Splunk to enable configurations.
#
# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) please see the documentation 
# located at http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Aboutconfigurationfiles
